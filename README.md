## Assignment list

### Mario.c
- Used C to create a program that would prompt a user for a number no greater than 23, then generate a half pyramid of #'s using the input as height. 

### Cash.c
- This program takes an input interpreted as a dollar amount, converts it into cents and then determines the least amount of coins needed to make that change using only quarters(25), dimes(10), nickels(5), and pennies(1). 

### Caesar.c
- This program takes a command line argument in the form of a positive number (and only one number) to create a cypher key with which to rotate the letters of the alphabet a number of times equal to the key. It prompts the user for a phrase with "plaintext: " then spits out the rotated phrase as "cyphertext: ".
